# Crime-Pattern-Visualization-R
This dataset is taken from Kaggle Competition on San Francisco Crime Classification Problem. 

I have provided with visualization of some of top categories of crime and lot more using Google maps API function in R i.e ggmap

There are 2 R files - Final script and Raw commands. Final script will contain exactly needed queries to get the output whereas raw_commands contains all the queries that I have tried during this project so that you can have idea on various methods and libraries to implement 

This repository also contain text document containing statistical details on the dataset to understand data even better

This can be useful for R beginners to explore API's of some of the famous applications within few steps in R language

Thank You
